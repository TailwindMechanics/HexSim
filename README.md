## Summary:
HexSim is a simple hexagon tile tick-based combat game where you control a flock of croissants by clicking and directing them en masse, while the enemy Beer Kegs attempt to kill and wipe out the Croissants. You can hit enter/return/esc/r to restart the scene. It's rough around the edges and there is a bug you can exploit to gain a strategic advantage. I have created a new hexagon coordinate system, Neese. The hexagon tiles are procedural, the tile map is procedural, and the map structure uses Perlin noise to define the terrain height and colour.
