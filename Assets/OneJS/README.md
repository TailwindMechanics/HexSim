Thank you everyone for the support! Just a quick note: Since Github doesn't allow setting collaborator permission for private free repos, everyone gets push access. Because of that, the main branch is set as a protected branch (to prevent potential accidents)

In most cases, you can just clone this repo directly under your Assets folder. If you encounter any issue when upgrading OneJS, you can try deleting `ScriptLib/` folder and `tsconfig.json` in your OneJS Working Directory. They will be automatically regenerated.
